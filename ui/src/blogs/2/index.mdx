#### What is a VPC
In this post I am going to cover some of the basics of an AWS VPC and show how I deploy one using Terraform

<br/>

For some basic terminology we can look at docs from AWS  - <Link href={vpcConcepts} target="_blank">Amazon VPC Concepts</Link>

<br/>
<br/>

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

The following are the key concepts for VPCs:

- Virtual private cloud (VPC) — A virtual network dedicated to your AWS account.
    - There's no additional charge for using a VPC. There are charges for the following VPC components: Site-to-Site VPN connection, PrivateLink, Traffic Mirroring, and a NAT gateway. For more information, see Amazon VPC Pricing.

- Subnet — A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. You can launch AWS resources into a specified subnet. Use a public subnet for resources that must be connected to the internet, and a private subnet for resources that won't be connected to the internet .

- Route table — A set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed. You can explicitly associate a subnet with a particular route table. Otherwise, the subnet is implicitly associated with the main route table.

- Internet gateway — A gateway that you attach to your VPC to enable communication between resources in your VPC and the internet.

- VPC endpoint — Enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network. For more information, see AWS PrivateLink and VPC endpoints.
    - <Link href={vpcEndpoints} target="_blank">AWS PrivateLink and VPC endpoints</Link>
    - <Link href={endPointPricing} target="_blank">AWS PrivateLink pricing</Link>
- CIDR block —Classless Inter-Domain Routing. An internet protocol address allocation and route aggregation methodology. For more information, see <Link href={cidr} target="_blank">Classless Inter-Domain Routing in Wikipedia</Link>.

From Wikipedia -
> The number of addresses inside a network or subnet may be calculated as 2address length − prefix length, where address length is 128 for IPv6 and 32 for IPv4. For example, in IPv4, the prefix length /29 gives: 2 ^ 32 − 29 = 2^3 = 8 addresses.

#### Network Planner
Looking at Wikipedia we can see CIDR masks that give us a starting point for planning a network

<Image p={4} verticalAlign='middle' src={props.images.NETWORKCIDR_IMAGE} />

To plan out our VPC we will use a network planner tool - <Link href={ipv4AddressPlan} target="_blank">IPv4 Address Planner</Link>

<br/>

We will give our VPC a 19 mask (2^32-19 = 2^13 = 8,092 addresses) and assume a uniform subnet size of 24 (2^32-24 = 2^8 = 256 addresses) which will give us room for 20 subnets in our VPC as shown by this plan:

<Image p={4} verticalAlign='middle' src={props.images.NETWORKPLAN_19_IMAGE} />

We will use this information to construct a VPC that looks like this:

<Image p={4} verticalAlign='middle' src={props.images.AWS_VPC_IMAGE} />

Now we can begin to create out resource definitions in <Link href={introTerraform} target="_blank">Terraform</Link> working from the outside in of our diagram.

<br/>

<Link p={4} href={vpcRepo} target="_blank">Code located here</Link>

<br/>
<br/>

The Region is defined by the provider
```json
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}
```

We will use terraform to manage our default route table that comes with our vpc and define a separate one for our public subnet.  We create a route in our main route table for our nat gateway and create a route for our internet gateway for our public subnet.
```json
## Create main route table
resource "aws_default_route_table" "main" {
  default_route_table_id = aws_vpc.vpc.default_route_table_id
  route {
    cidr_block     = "0.0.0.0/0"
    nat_gateway_id = aws_nat_gateway.i.id
  }

  tags = merge(
    var.base_tags,
    {
      Name = "${var.resource_prefix}-main-rt"
    },
  )
}

## Create route table
resource "aws_route_table" "i_public" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.vpc.id
  route {
    cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
    gateway_id = aws_internet_gateway.igw.id
  }
  tags = merge(
    var.base_tags,
    {
      Name = "${var.resource_prefix}-rt"
    },
  )
}

## Associate route tables with subnets
resource "aws_route_table_association" "i_subnet_private" {
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.subnet_private.id
  route_table_id = aws_default_route_table.main.id
}

resource "aws_route_table_association" "i_subnet_public" {
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.subnet_public.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.i_public.id
}


```
The VPC is defined by the aws_vpc resource using a variable to pass in the cidr block
```json
## Create vpc
resource "aws_vpc" "vpc" {
  cidr_block           = var.cidr_vpc
  instance_tenancy     = "default"
  enable_dns_support   = true
  enable_dns_hostnames = true

  tags = merge(
    var.base_tags,
    {
      Name = "${var.resource_prefix}-vpc"
    },
  )
}
```

We attach an internet gateway to the VPC with the aws_internet_gateway resource using the vpc id
```json
## Create internet gateway
resource "aws_internet_gateway" "igw" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.vpc.id
  tags = merge(
    var.base_tags,
    {
      Name = "${var.resource_prefix}-igw"
    },
  )
}
```
Then we define a nat gateway to allow our private subnet instances to egress to the internet
```json
resource "aws_nat_gateway" "i" {
  allocation_id = aws_eip.i.id
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.subnet_public.id

  tags = merge(
    var.base_tags,
    {
      Name = "${var.resource_prefix}-natgw"
    },
  )
}

resource "aws_eip" "i" {
  vpc = true
  tags = merge(
    var.base_tags,
    {
      Name = "${var.resource_prefix}-eip"
    },
  )
}
```
We can then create our private and public subnets using the aws_subnet resource and again using variables for the subnet cidr blocks and availability zones
```json
## Create public subnet
resource "aws_subnet" "subnet_public" {
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.vpc.id
  cidr_block              = var.cidr_subnet_public
  map_public_ip_on_launch = "true"
  availability_zone       = var.availability_zone
  tags = merge(
    var.base_tags,
    {
      Name   = "${var.resource_prefix}-vpc-subnet-public"
      Access = "public"
    },
  )
}

## Create private subnet
resource "aws_subnet" "subnet_private" {
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.vpc.id
  cidr_block              = var.cidr_subnet_private
  map_public_ip_on_launch = "false"
  availability_zone       = var.availability_zone
  tags = merge(
    var.base_tags,
    {
      Name   = "${var.resource_prefix}-vpc-subnet-private"
      Access = "private"
    },
  )
}
```

Within our terraform directory

<Image p={4} verticalAlign='middle' src={props.images.VPC_FOLDER_IMAGE} />

We run terraform init to generate our local state

<Image p={4} verticalAlign='middle' src={props.images.VPC_FOLDER2_IMAGE} />

Then we can run a plan to see what will be created
```
terraform plan

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
"terraform apply" is subsequently run.

And then we can run terraform apply to create (hint: the provider override file contains my aws credentials)

Apply complete! Resources: 10 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

private_subnet_id = "subnet-017347820c7bb83c8"
public_subnet_id = "subnet-0edd369fe4214404d"
vpc_id = "vpc-0ee271c94e219deea"


```

Then we can take a look at the AWS Console to see the results of our terraform run:

<Image p={4} verticalAlign='middle' src={props.images.VPC_CONSOLE_IMAGE} />

<Image p={4} verticalAlign='middle' src={props.images.SUBNET_PRIVATE_IMAGE} />

<Image p={4} verticalAlign='middle' src={props.images.SUBNET_PUBLIC_IMAGE} />

<Image p={4} verticalAlign='middle' src={props.images.IGW_IMAGE} />

<Image p={4} verticalAlign='middle' src={props.images.ROUTE_TABLE_PUBLIC_IMAGE} />

<Image p={4} verticalAlign='middle' src={props.images.ROUTE_TABLE_MAIN_IMAGE} />

<br/>

As we can see all our resources were created.

To clean it all up again we can just run destroy:
