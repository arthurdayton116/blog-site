# What's here
This is a repo that demonstrates how to build and deploy a Serverless application.

It uses React to create a blog site deployed into an S3 bucket fronted by CloudFront.

You can see a working example, including an explanation of how I designed and built it, at arthurdayton.com

For simplicity I am taking a mono-repo approach and using GitHub actions for deployment and Terraform Cloud for state storage.

## Folder Structure

### .github/workflows
Contains workflpw file for GitHub Actions

### ui
Contains React project for deploying UI

### Terraform
Contains multiple subfolders for deploying infrastructure needed to deploy and run blog site on AWS

#### terraform_cf
Contains code for deploying cloudfront distribution of site

##### terraform_dns
Contains code for deploying dns records and certificate 

#### terraform_dynamoDB
Contains code for deploying DynamoDB table and indexes.

#### terraform_grahql
Contains code for building and deploying graphql server on lambda.

#### terraform_s3
Contains code for deploying S3 bucket used as source for cloud front distribution.

#### terraform_shared
Contains code for creating remote state outputs used by other terraform directories.

#### terraform_sns
Contains code for creating simple notification topic.

TODO - terratest

- It is possible for people to understand all of this stuff but very hard to keep it all in memory and not become overly reliant on experts.
- This proves it can be done but also highlights the hard part that is the value you have to be able to deliver on

- Setting up x as a service and enabling teams and platform, etc. is necessary

- Needs to be open and not black boxed but also usable without 

- Exploring the mono-repo

- Enabling local development

- Configuring linters and code editors

- Where are fracture plane and team boundries
